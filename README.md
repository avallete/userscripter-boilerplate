# userscripter-boilerplate

A quick boilerplate for userscripter projects with e2e testing using cypress, ava for unit-testing, semantic-release and CI/CD with github actions

## What's in ?

- Easy unit-testing and coverage using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
- Ready to go e2e-testing using [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)
- Automatic build, version, and releases using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and precommit checks using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for better code consistency
- Already configured eslint with plugins for TS and JS, some worth to be mentioned:
  - [airbnb/base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) base for TS and JS (you may want to add react to it)
  - [eslint-plugin-unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn)
  - [eslint-plugin-radar](https://github.com/es-joy/eslint-plugin-radar)
